## Git and GitHub

I've had some general idea about Git and basic concepts like commits, branches, merging and pull requests. However how it all is done in practice seemed like rocket science to me (especially "scary" rebasing, cherry-picks and resolving merge conflicts). Now I see it is absolutely not :).  
Pretty much everything in the courses was **new to me**:

- making changes to commits with `git revert` and `git reset`
- working with remote repo with `git push`, `git fetch` and `git pull`
- juggling branches with `git rebase`, `git merge`, `git cherry-pick` etc.

## Linux CLI and HTTP

I had no problems with this task. I mastered Linux in a technical school by performing laboratory work. But it was still useful to repeat the commands.

Regarding the articles about HTTP, I learned a lot of new things in them, since before that I had only superficial knowledge

## Git Collaboration

After completing all the tasks, I structured the knowledge that I already had on working with GitHub Learned how to work with fork

## HTML & CSS Practice (https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/tasks/html-css-popup.md)

It was interesting to know that you can react to button press events on a pure css

Watch the [Demo](https://maxim-zabolotny.github.io/maxim-zabolotny-html-css-popup.github.io/)

And check the [Code base](https://github.com/maxim-zabolotny/kottans-frontend/tree/main/html-css-popup)

## JS Basics
Previously, I already knew the basics of js including es6. Principles of functional programming were new to me:
1. Don't alter a variable or object - create new variables and objects and return them if need be from a function.
2. Declare function arguments - any computation inside a function depends only on the arguments, and not on any global object or variable.

FreeCodeCamp tasks were pretty easy at the first, but then became more complicated and I needed to looking for some extra materials.
